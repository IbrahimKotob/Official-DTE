SkyTrack Airline Management System

SkyTrack was designed to be an airline management system website that focuses on the customer experience, with its extraordinary interface that although is simplistic, is able to encompass all the needs of its users.

1-Main Page:
	Starting off with the main page the user is greeted with a menu and a read more button which, when clicked on redirects the user to another page containing additional information about the airline, and the services it provides.
2-Login/Signup:
	In order to access any of the other features of the website, one must either create a new account through sign-up or login into an existing one. The sign-up process is fairly simple where a user is asked to input their information and create brand new credentials for the website, and so is the login process which asks the user to enter the credentials they have created during the sign-up process.
3-Book A Flight:
	This page is the bread and butter of the website, where after logging in, users are able to input flight departure and arrival details such as location and date, and after clicking on the “search flights” button, they are then redirected to another page called the preferences page.
 4-Preferences Page:
	The preferences page takes into account the flight details requested by the user in the “Book A Flight” page and shows a number of flight cards reflecting the number of flights found within the system that match the user’s inputs. These flight cards will display the departure and arrival dates, locations, and flight prices. Clicking on one of the flight cards will result in a pop-up window allowing the customer to further customize their flight, by picking seat type, meal type, and special needs accommodation. Once all the preferences are set, the user can click on “Book Now!” to finalize their booking process.
5-Schedule Page:
	The schedule page shows all upcoming flights for the user who is currently logged into the system and their details.
6-Loyalty Program:
	The loyalty program is available for all customers and explains the requirements and benefits of joining it. The loyalty program works automatically, where each time a customer books a flight with us, they earn a certain number of points, and after those points reach a certain threshold, their passenger class increases, allowing for more benefits with our airline. 
7-Admin Page:
	Logging in with an admin account will take the user to an admin page, which is only reserved for employees of the airline, where they can create, delete, and adjust flight details.
